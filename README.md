## Audio-Classification

The task of identifying what an audio represents is called audio classification. An audio classification model is trained to recognize various audio events. For example, you may train a model to recognize events representing three different events: clapping, finger snapping, and typing. TensorFlow Lite provides optimized pre-trained models that you can deploy in your mobile applications.
